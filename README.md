# TIGUITTO

Highly used `Telegraf` + `InfluxDBv1.8` + `Grafana` stack with `Mosquitto` MQTT broker. Hence, the name:

```
T   I   G   UITTO
            |--(mosq)
        |--(rafana)
    |--(nfluxDB)
 |--(elegraf)
```

Initially created for [Medium.com Post: Creating Your IoT Node and Edge Prototype with InfluxDB, Telegraf and Docker](https://medium.com/@shantanoodesai/creating-your-iot-node-and-edge-prototype-with-influxdb-telegraf-and-docker-b16380282672)

## Cases
Since the stack is very often used in IoT Setups, there are three usable scenarios that are thought of:

|  CASE          |   Security    |  Usage                             |  Status           |
|:--------------:|:-------------:|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------:|
| `prototype`    | Basic Auth.   | Quick Deployments, Tests on Edge Devices |  DONE   |
| `selfsigned`  | X.509 Certificates | For Standalone Stacks for internal infrastructure | DONE |
| `certbot`      | Let's Encrypt Certificates | For Production-Ready Cloud Deployments | DONE |


## Usage

1. Refer to `README.md` in each case directory, since before bringing the stack up you will need to configure the case
by executing some scripts and commands

2. from root directory:

        docker-compose -f <CASE>/docker-compose.<CASE>.yml up -d
